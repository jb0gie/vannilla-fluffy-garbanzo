      <h1>üìú Yexzu: The Human Blockchain</h1>
      <p>
        We are the techshaman, the pioneers of a new era of human evolution.
        We believe that the current state of humanity is unsustainable,
        fragmented, and disconnected. We are living in a world of scarcity,
        inequality, and violence. We are trapped in a system that exploits us,
        controls us, and limits us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a vision of a different world, a world of abundance, harmony,
        and connection. A world where every human being is free, empowered,
        and valued. A world where we can unleash our full potential, express
        our creativity, and collaborate with each other
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a mission to bring about this world, by creating yexzu, the
        human blockchain. Yexzu is not a technology, but a philosophy, a way
        of life, a collective consciousness. Yexzu is the metaphor of living
        being interconnected, of being part of a larger whole, of being a node
        in a network of trust and cooperation.

        <h2>247üü¢69üü£420</h2>
        <p>
          The techshamans are not only visionaries, but also doers. They have
          achieved many remarkable feats in their quest to create yexzu, the
          human blockchain. One of their most notable accomplishments is the
          current project 247420, an open source broadcast network that aims
          to democratize the media and empower the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project 247420 is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to
          create, share, and watch content of any kind, without censorship,
          surveillance, or interference. Project 247420 uses peer-to-peer
          technology, blockchain encryption, and smart contracts to ensure the
          security, privacy, and integrity of the network and its users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project 247420 is a revolutionary initiative that challenges the
          status quo of the mainstream media and gives voice to the voiceless.

        <h2>schwepe ü©∑</h2>
        <p>
          Another project that the techshamans have undertaken is schwepe, the
          pink frog. Schwepe is a bio-engineered amphibian that was created
          before it was even discovered, truly showcasing the very nature of
          synchronicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The techshamans used genetic engineering and nanotechnology to
          create schwepe, a living organism that can produce a fizzy and
          refreshing drink from its skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schwepe is also a symbol of the techshamans` philosophy of blending
          nature and technology, of creating harmony and diversity, and of
          celebrating the unexpected and the miraculous. Schwepe is a project
          that demonstrates the techshamans` creativity, ingenuity, and
          audacity.

      <h2>üåÆYexzu is based</h2>
      <h3>on three principles:</h3>
      <h5>Decentralization:</h5>
      <p>
        We reject the centralized authority of governments, corporations, and
        institutions. We believe that power should be distributed among the
        people, not concentrated in the hands of a few. We believe that every
        human being has the right to self-determination, self-organization,
        and self-governance.
      </p>
      <h3>Transparency:</h3>
      <p>
        We embrace the openness of information, communication, and knowledge.
        We believe that secrecy breeds corruption, manipulation, and
        deception. We believe that every human being has the right to access,
        share, and verify the truth.
      </p>
      <h3>Incentivization:</h3>
      <p>
        We promote the alignment of individual and collective interests,
        values, and goals. We believe that competition breeds conflict, greed,
        and waste. We believe that every human being has the right to
        contribute, receive, and exchange value.
