# TechShaman's Interdimensional Portal 🌌

A mesmerizing 3D web experience built with Three.js, featuring floating text, animated models, and interactive elements - all in one HTML file! No build step required, because we like to keep it simple (and maybe a little chaotic).

## Features 🚀

- Pure vanilla JavaScript and Three.js
- No build tools, no bundlers, no package managers
- Everything runs in a single HTML file (because why make life complicated?)
- Interactive 3D text that orbits around a central model
- Custom loading screen with animated geometry
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Post-processing effects for that extra ✨sparkle✨

## Getting Started 🎮

1. Clone this repo
2. Run a local server (e.g., `npx http-server ./`)
3. Open your browser and wait... and wait... and maybe wait a bit more...
   (Hey, you try loading a 3D universe in a single file! 😅)

## Why One File? 🤔

Because sometimes the best solution is the simplest one! This project proves you don't need a complex build system to create something awesome. Just good old HTML, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of Three.js magic.

Benefits:

- Zero build configuration
- Easy to deploy (just upload one file!)
- No dependency management headaches
- Perfect for prototyping and experimentation

## Loading Time Joke ⏳

Q: Why did the TechShaman website take so long to load?
A: Because it had to gather energy from all dimensions simultaneously!
(Actually, it's just loading a bunch of 3D assets, but the interdimensional thing sounds cooler)

## Credits 🙏

Built with:

- Three.js
- A lot of coffee

_Note: If the site takes too long to load, try meditating. The TechShaman recommends it anyway._ 🧘‍♂️
